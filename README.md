{
  "domain": "<YOUR AUTH0 DOMAIN>",
  "clientId": "<YOUR AUTH0 CLIENT ID>"
}

What is Auth0?
Auth0 helps you to:

Add authentication with multiple authentication sources, either social like Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others, or enterprise identity systems like Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider.
Add authentication through more traditional username/password databases.
Add support for linking different user accounts with the same user.
Support for generating signed Json Web Tokens to call your APIs and flow the user identity securely.
Analytics of how, when and where users are logging in.
Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through JavaScript rules.
Create a Free Auth0 Account
Go to Auth0 and click Sign Up.
Use Google, GitHub or Microsoft Account to login.
